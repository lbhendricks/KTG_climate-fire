```{r}
# read in the data. have to have both date and time as character because they need to be combined before being turned into a time object
detections_500km<-read.table("/Users/laurenhendricks/Documents/Borneo/Ketapang_ClimateFire/mcd14ml_KTG_500km.txt",sep=" ",header=T,colClasses = c("character","character","factor","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","integer","numeric","integer","factor"))

# also need to add a leading 0 to AM times (otherwise it doesnt' seem to work)
detections_500km$HHMM2<-ifelse(nchar(detections_500km$HHMM)<4,paste0(0,detections_500km$HHMM),detections_500km$HHMM) 

# combine the date and the time
detections_500km$time<-paste(detections_500km$YYYYMMDD," ",detections_500km$HHMM2)

# then turn it into a date! 
detections_500km$time<-as.POSIXct(detections_500km$time,format="%Y%m%d %H%M")

# and turn the year into a date object too
detections_500km$YYYYMMDD<-as.POSIXct(detections_500km$YYYYMMDD,format="%Y%m%d")

# pull out the first two digits of the time to figure out what hour of the day it is during, and convert that to a number
detections_500km$hour<-as.numeric(substr(detections_500km$HHMM2,1,2))

# then we can make a table showing how many happen per hour
t<-table(detections_500km$hour)

plot(t)
barplot(t)

# delete the column with time as the leading 0
#detections_500km$HHMM2<-NULL
```
So, some thoughts on this. There aren't any detections between 7 AM and 2 PM. BUT this isn't necessarily accurate--need to look into how the detections are made more (maybe it's not recording this area in the middle of the day?)
